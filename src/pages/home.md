# Discovering the Foundations of the Universe

A vibrant research centre connecting astroparticle physics, gravitational physics and cosmology

## Study the foundations of the Universe

What makes the Universe tick? The GRAPPA master program focuses on particle physics, astroparticle physics and cosmology at the intersection of theory, experiments and observation. It includes a full year MSc project working on real research supervised by world-leading faculty

## Pushing the frontiers of knowledge about the Universe at its extremes

Research at GRAPPA aims at a better understanding of natural phenomena at the very smallest, very largest and most energetic extremes. To this end, we bring together gravitational waves, string theory, dark matter searches, high energy astrophysics and cosmology, and stimulate cross-fertilization of the different research directions.

## An actively connected research community

Through colloquia, journal clubs, discussion groups and international visitor programs, we stimulate new interactions between GRAPPA researchers and with the international community.

## Testimonials
> “In GRAPPA you will feel like you’re diving into an international atmosphere surrounded by fascinating courses and seminars, which are on the edge of current knowledge.
> —Ariane Dekker, Master's student
