# Discovering the Foundations of the Universe

A vibrant research centre connecting astroparticle physics, gravitational physics and cosmology

## Study the foundations of the Universe

What makes the Universe tick? The GRAPPA master program focuses on particle physics, astroparticle physics and cosmology at the intersection of theory, experiments and observation. It includes a full year MSc project working on real research supervised by world-leading faculty

## Pushing the frontiers of knowledge about the Universe at its extremes

Research at GRAPPA aims at a better understanding of natural phenomena at the very smallest, very largest and most energetic extremes. To this end, we bring together gravitational waves, string theory, dark matter searches, high energy astrophysics and cosmology, and stimulate cross-fertilization of the different research directions.

## An actively connected research community

Through colloquia, journal clubs, discussion groups and international visitor programs, we stimulate new interactions between GRAPPA researchers and with the international community.

GRAPPA researchers have wide research interests, including dark matter phenomenology, cosmic rays, high-energy astrophysics, cosmology, black holes physics, gravitational waves, and string theory. It also includes experimental physicists active in the Antares/KM3NeT, ATLAS, CTA, LOFAR, and XENON1T collaborations.

The aim of the new center is to bring together theoretical physicists, astronomers and particle physicists, in order to answer some of the most profound questions in Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology:
- What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy?
- How can the forces of Nature be unified?
- Does this unification leave measurable signatures in the present Universe?
- What do black holes and neutron stars teach us about the fundamental laws of physics?
- How are cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, gamma rays and gravity waves produced? And what do they tell us about extreme environments in the Universe?
