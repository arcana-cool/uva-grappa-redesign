GRAPPA MSc coordinator: [Patrick Decowski](http://grappa.amsterdam/members/patrick-decowski/)
## What is GRAPPA?
GRAPPA stands for **GR**avitation, **A**stro- and **P**article **P**hysics. In GRAPPA we investigate questions in particle physics, astroparticle physics and cosmology at the intersection of theory, particle physics and astrophysics.

Are you interested in questions such as:

- How did the universe come to be?
- What is dark matter?
- What are the properties of the Higgs particle?
- Is there something beyond the Standard Model of particle physics?
- What is the origin of cosmic rays?
- What particles is the universe built of?
- What is gravity?
- And many others…

If these questions intrigue you, the answers (or in some cases the lack of answers), will interest you even more! The GRAPPA track is for ambitious students interested in gravitation, astroparticle and particle physics, giving you a broad curriculum. Members of our group are theorists and experimentalists and you will be able to specialize in either theoretical, experimental (astro)particle physics or astrophysics.
